= RailsAdminVin

The controller is in lib/rails_admin_vin.rb
and the view is in app/views/rails_admin/main/vin.html.erb


Now you have the controller and the view, you dont have the restriction of rails_admin but make sure you use the power of code...


Remember the best code, is the code not written!
